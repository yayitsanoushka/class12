        <h1>Why the FWN album is my favorite album</h1>
        <p>Favorite Worst Nightmare is my favorite album from Arctic Monkeys and I also think that it is their best album overall. I think this because out of all their albums (WPSIATWIN, FWN, Humbug, AM, SIAS, TBHC and The Car), it has the catchiest and most fun to sing songs. Though it does not have many slow songs, it was clear that Arctic Monkeys understood the need for slow songs in the middle of fast-paced albums such as this one. With an opening as ferocious as Brianstorm and a closing as calming as 505, with Only Ones Who Know, the slowest song in the album, right in the middle, Favorite Worst Nightmare is a rollercoaster of an album, with both fast and slow parts. I hope this convinces you to listen to Favorite Worst Nightmare. </p>
